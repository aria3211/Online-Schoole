# Motivation
Life in school is very boring. Teachers usually keep talking on and on while students passively watch them. But it doesn't have to be like that. There are modern methodologies like [Active Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning),and [Flipped Classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom). These concepts can make a huge difference in motivation and performance
